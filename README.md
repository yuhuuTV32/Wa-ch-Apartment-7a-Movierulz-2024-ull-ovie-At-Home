"Apartment 7a" follows the story of Guru (Mohit Agarwal), a young man trapped in a claustrophobic existence within his family home in Apartment 7a, India. Working a dead-end call center job, Guru yearns for intimacy and escape but finds himself stifled by the oppressive patriarchal structures that govern his life. His father, "Daddy ji" (Rahul Roy), is a domineering figure who exerts control over the household, while his mother, "Mummy ji" (Vibha Chibber), remains complicit in this power dynamic. Guru's desires are further complicated by his infatuation with his aunt, "Aunty ji" (Sonal Jha), and his strained relationship with his cousin, Chhavi (Aanchal Goswami).
